# CookieCoder
A text-based game based on the infamous <a href="http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/">Cookie Clicker</a> with a twist:
instead of clicking to generate more cookies, one must create the cookies by typing `cookies -add <name>` into the "shell".
Additional commands are there for you to discover, as well as a store to improve your cookie coding productivity (although if you're playing this game, maybe productivity isn't your highest priority).

You can play it <a href="http://naitian.github.io/CookieCoder/">here</a>.
